            # Disabled because with typescript, the 10.x build fails by running out
            # of heap space. I can't figure out how to increase heap size on the build
            # but since we're dropping support for 10.x soon, I think this is fine.
            # Tests still run on all the other versions, and we publish from 16.x now,
            # so we I think we're fine to disable it for the next few releases.
            # See you in 2035.
