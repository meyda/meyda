- [audiotrainer-server](https://github.com/Number-42/audiotrainer-server) by [Number-42](https://github.com/Number-42).

> A simple program meant to correlate increases in heart rate in ASD-diagnosed children to changes in the features of ambient sounds (both sets of data prerecorded over the same period of time) with the intent of optimizing a training program helping them cope with sounds abnormally stress-inducing to them.

- [OSEM](https://uduk.org/osem/) by [@uduk](https://github.com/uduk)

> A computer generated melody project, optionally users can plug-in their guitar and/or MIDI key controller to dictate input harmonic. Meyda.js is being used to extract audio signal features, such as beat dynamic and music segmentation in order to help OSEM to produce high-quality music melody. It is meant to answer the question: "Given an arbitrary backing track (format: wav, mp3) can computer compose?"
